        Thanks for playing!

        This was a simple implementation of a javascript neural network 

        <a href="https://github.com/harthur/brain" target="_blank">Brain</a>,

        with data supported by the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/" target="_blank">Open Secrets Api</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        What you did was train this neural network by connecting the preference outcome to the input points you saw.
